At its simplest, a thread pool is a fixed number of worker threads (typically the same
number as the value returned by std::thread::hardware_concurrency()) that pro-
cess work. When you have work to do, you call a function to put it on the queue of
pending work. Each worker thread takes work off the queue, runs the specified task,
and then goes back to the queue for more work. In the simplest case thereâ€™s no way to
wait for the task to complete. If you need to do this, you have to manage the synchro-
nization yourself.
