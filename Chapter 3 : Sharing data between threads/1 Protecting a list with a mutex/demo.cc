In C++, you create a mutex by constructing an instance of std::mutex, lock it with a
call to the member function lock(), and unlock it with a call to the member func-
tion unlock(). However, it isnâ€™t recommended practice to call the member functions
directly, because this means that you have to remember to call unlock() on every
code path out of a function, including those due to exceptions. Instead, the Standard
C++ Library provides the std::lock_guard class template, which implements that
RAII idiom for a mutex; it locks the supplied mutex on construction and unlocks it
on destruction, thus ensuring a locked mutex is always correctly unlocked. The fol-
lowing listing shows how to protect a list that can be accessed by multiple threads
using a std::mutex, along with std::lock_guard. Both of these are declared in the
<mutex> header.
